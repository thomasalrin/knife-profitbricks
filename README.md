You need to provide you Profitbricks username and password, either add them to your knife.rb

    profitbricks_username = 'YOUR USERNAME'
    profitbricks_password = 'YOUR PASSWORD'

or store them in environment variables

    export PROFITBRICKS_USER=YOURUSERNAME
    export PROFITBRICKS_PASSWORD=YOURPASSWORd


## SUBCOMMANDS:

This plugin provides the following Knife subcommands. Specific command options can be found by invoking the subcommand with a ``--help`` flag

### knife profitbricks server create

Provisions a new server and then perform a Chef bootstrap (using the SSH protocol). The goal of the bootstrap is to get Chef installed
on the target system so it can run Chef Client with a Chef Server.

During provisioning your public SSH key will be uploaded to the newly created server, thus you should make sure a public key exists at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` or provide a different key via the `--public-key-file` option.

The following knife-profitbricks options are required:

    -D DATACENTER_NAME,              The datacenter where the server will be created
        --data-center
        --name SERVER_NAME           name for the newly created Server

These knife-profitbricks options are optional:

        --cpus CPUS                  Amount of CPUs of the new Server
        --ram RAM                    Amount of Memory in MB of the new Server
        --hdd-size GB                Size of storage in GB
    -i, --image-name IMAGE_NAME      The image name which will be used to create the initial server 'template',

    -S, --snaphot-name SNAPSHOT_NAME The snapshot name which will be used to create the server
                                       (can not be used with the image-name option)

    -k PUBLIC_KEY_FILE,              The SSH public key file to be added to the authorized_keys of the given user,
        --public-key-file              default is '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub'

    -x, --ssh-user USERNAME          The ssh username

The following are optional options provided by knife:

        --[no-]bootstrap             Bootstrap the server with knife bootstrap
    -N, --node-name NAME             The Chef node name for your new node default is the name of the server.

        --disable-editing            Do not open EDITOR, just accept the data as is
    -d, --distro DISTRO              Bootstrap a distro using a template; default is 'ubuntu12.04-gems'
    -e, --editor EDITOR              Set the editor to use for interactive commands
    -E, --environment ENVIRONMENT    Set the Chef environment
    -F, --format FORMAT              Which format to use for output
        --identity-file IDENTITY_FILE
                                     The SSH identity file used for authentication

## EXAMPLE

First you need an existing DataCenter, you can create it via the [DCD](https://my.profitbricks.com/dashboard/dcd/) or just use the profitbricks command which got installed via the [profitbricks](https://github.com/dsander/profitbricks) gem which is a dependency of knife-profitbricks:

    profitbricks data_center create name=demo

You are now set up to create a new server:

    knife profitbricks server create --data-center demo --name test --ram 512 --cpus 1
